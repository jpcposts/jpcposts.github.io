Have you ever needed to store a password securely without exposing it in plain text? One way to achieve this is by using a SHA512 hashed password. In this blog post, we will learn how to create a SHA512 hashed password using the terminal.

To get started, open your terminal and issue the following command:

```bash
sudo openssl passwd -6 -salt SALT PASSWORD
```

Replace **SALT** with a random string that will act as a salt for the hashing process. The salt adds additional security to the hashed password. Additionally, replace **PASSWORD** with the desired password you want to hash.

Please note that it is recommended not to use special characters like ! in the password, as they may cause issues with the command.

Once you execute the command, the terminal will generate a SHA512 hashed password. You can now use this hashed password in your playbooks, scripts, or any other applications where you need to store or transmit passwords securely.

By using a hashed password, you prevent the password from being stored in plain text, which adds an extra layer of security. Even if someone gains access to the hashed password, it is computationally difficult to reverse-engineer it back to the original password.

Remember to store the generated hashed password in a safe place. If you need to use the password later, you can compare the hashed value of the entered password with the stored hashed password to verify its correctness.

Creating a SHA512 hashed password provides a secure way to handle passwords in various applications. By implementing this method, you can ensure that sensitive information remains protected even if your systems are compromised.

Start using SHA512 hashed passwords today and enhance the security of your applications and systems!

Now that you know how to create a SHA512 hashed password using the terminal, go ahead and leverage this technique to secure your sensitive data.

_Happy hashing!!!_
