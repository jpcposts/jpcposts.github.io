In Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9, you can easily create an ISO image from a directory using the `mkisofs` utility. This can be incredibly useful for archiving data or preparing files for distribution. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create an ISO image from a directory in RHEL 8:

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the required package installed. The `mkisofs` utility is a part of the `genisoimage` package. You can install it using the following command if it's not already installed:

```bash
sudo dnf install genisoimage
```


## Steps to Create an ISO Image

### 1. Create the ISO Image:

Use the `mkisofs` command to create the ISO image. The basic syntax is as follows:

```bash
mkisofs -o output.iso source_directory
```

Replace output.iso with the desired name for your ISO file and source_directory with the path to the directory you want to include in the ISO image.

For example, to create an ISO image named **rhel9_epel.iso** from a directory called **RHEL9_EPEL**, you can use the following command:

```bash
mkisofs -o rhel9_epel.iso RHEL9_EPEL
```

This command will create the rhel9_epel.iso ISO image in the current working directory.

### 2. Optional: Verify the ISO Image:

After creating the ISO image, you may want to verify it to ensure its integrity. You can use the isoinfo command for this purpose. For example:

```bash
isoinfo -d -i rhel9_epel.iso
```

This command will display information about the ISO image, including its volume label and directory structure.

In the world of system administration and software distribution, there are several scenarios where creating an ISO image from a directory becomes invaluable. One common use case is for system recovery and backup purposes. By bundling critical data, configurations, or installation files into a single ISO, you ensure that essential components are readily accessible, making system restoration a breeze.

Additionally, ISO images are a favored format for distributing software, especially in environments where downloading large files can be challenging. System administrators often use ISOs to package custom software, updates, or entire Linux distributions, simplifying deployment across multiple servers or machines. Furthermore, ISOs are a go-to choice for creating bootable media, whether it's for installing a new operating system, running diagnostic tools, or performing system rescue operations.

In these scenarios, the ability to create ISO images from directories in RHEL 8 streamlines various administrative tasks and enhances system reliability.


## Conclusion

Creating an ISO image from a directory in RHEL 8 is a straightforward process, thanks to the mkisofs utility. Whether you need to archive data, distribute files, or perform system backups, this method provides a convenient way to package your content into a single ISO file. Once you have your ISO image, you can burn it to a CD/DVD or mount it as a loopback device for further exploration or distribution.
