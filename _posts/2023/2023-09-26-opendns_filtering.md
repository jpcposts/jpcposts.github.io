Network security is a top priority for individuals, families, and organizations. OpenDNS filtering, provided by OpenDNS (now part of Cisco Umbrella), is a robust cybersecurity feature designed to bolster network security by giving administrators granular control over internet access. In this article, we'll delve into what OpenDNS filtering is and how it enhances network security.

## Content Filtering: Control Over Web Access

**Content filtering** lies at the core of OpenDNS filtering. It empowers administrators to regulate and restrict access to specific websites or categories of websites, providing several crucial benefits:

### 1. Parental Controls

For concerned parents, OpenDNS content filtering is a powerful tool to create a safer online environment for children. It allows parents to block access to adult content, gambling websites, or social media platforms, ensuring that young users are shielded from inappropriate material.

### 2. Workplace Security

In a corporate setting, OpenDNS content filtering serves as a productivity enhancer. Employers can use it to block access to non-work-related websites during business hours, encouraging employees to stay focused on their tasks. Additionally, this reduces security risks associated with unapproved websites that may harbor malware or other threats.

### 3. Network Security

One of the primary advantages of content filtering is network security. By blocking known malicious websites and domains, OpenDNS acts as a proactive shield against a wide range of online threats. If a device attempts to access a site known for distributing malware or hosting phishing attacks, OpenDNS intervenes, preventing the connection and adding an extra layer of security.

## Security Filtering: Protection Against Online Threats

In addition to content filtering, OpenDNS offers **security filtering** to safeguard networks against various online threats:

### 1. Phishing Protection

OpenDNS excels at identifying and blocking phishing websites. Phishing sites are designed to deceive users into revealing sensitive information like login credentials, credit card numbers, and personal data. OpenDNS's vigilance in this area protects users from falling victim to these deceptive traps.

### 2. Malware Protection

Malware, including viruses, trojans, and ransomware, poses a significant threat to networks and devices. OpenDNS steps in to prevent access to websites known for distributing malware. By doing so, it helps keep devices and networks safe from potentially devastating infections.

### 3. Botnet Protection

Botnets are networks of compromised devices controlled by cybercriminals. OpenDNS identifies and blocks connections to known botnet command and control servers, thwarting attempts to compromise devices on the network. This proactive defense is invaluable in maintaining network integrity.

### 4. DNS Rebinding Protection

DNS rebinding attacks manipulate DNS responses to compromise internal network devices. OpenDNS provides protection against these attacks by filtering out DNS responses containing IP addresses listed in RFC1918. This vital safeguard ensures that devices on your network remain secure.

## DNS-Based Filtering for Network-Wide Protection

OpenDNS filtering operates at the DNS (Domain Name System) level. It intercepts and filters DNS queries made by devices on the network. When a device attempts to access a website, OpenDNS checks the website's domain against its extensive database of filtered content and security threats. If a match is found, OpenDNS either allows or blocks access based on the administrator's pre-configured policies.

A key advantage of DNS-based filtering, such as that provided by OpenDNS, is its network-wide coverage. It applies to all devices connected to the network, including smartphones, computers, IoT (Internet of Things) devices, and more. This centralized approach streamlines management and ensures comprehensive security coverage for all connected devices.

In summary, OpenDNS filtering is a potent cybersecurity tool that empowers network administrators, parents, and organizations to manage internet access and protect against a wide array of online threats. By offering content filtering and security filtering at the DNS level, OpenDNS enhances network security while maintaining ease of management and deployment.
