## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to install Homebridge on your Synology NAS using Docker:

1 **Create a Directory**: Launch File Station on your NAS and navigate to the Docker directory. Create a directory named "homebridge" (all lowercase).

2 **Set Up a Scheduled Task**:
   - Navigate to Control Panel > Task Scheduler > Create > Scheduled Task > User-defined script.
   - In the Task field, type "Install Homebridge." Uncheck the "Enabled" option. Select the root user.

-e DSM_HOSTNAME=YOUR_NAS_HOSTNAME
-e PACKAGES=ffmpeg
-v /volume1/docker/homebridge:/homebridge
--net=host
--restart always
oznu/homebridge:latest
```

   - Click OK to save the task.

4 **Execute the Task**: Select the "Install Homebridge" task and click the "Run" tab to execute the task. The installation process will take about 3-5 minutes.
