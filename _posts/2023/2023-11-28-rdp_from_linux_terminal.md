## Steps to Connect to a Remote Windows System

Now, let's dive into the steps for connecting to a remote Windows system from your Linux command line.

1. Open your terminal.
2. Use the `xfreerdp` command with the following syntax:

```bash
xfreerdp /u:<username> /v:<remote_windows_ip_or_hostname>
```

Replace `username` with your Windows username and `remote_windows_ip_or_hostname` with the IP address or hostname of the remote Windows machine. **For example:**

```bash
xfreerdp /u:user1 /v:192.168.1.113
```

After entering the command, you will be prompted to enter your Windows password. Provide your password and press `Enter`.

You may be prompted to `trust the above certificate` press `Y` then `Enter`

If the credentials are correct, you will be connected to the remote Windows machine, and the Windows desktop will appear within your Linux terminal.

- /f: Full-screen mode.

## Conclusion

Using the xfreerdp package, you can easily connect to a remote Windows system from your Linux terminal. This is a convenient way to manage Windows machines when you're primarily working in a Linux environment. With the right credentials and a few simple commands, you can access the remote Windows desktop seamlessly.
