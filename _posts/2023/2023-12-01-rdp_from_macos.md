Are you a macOS user who needs to access a Windows computer remotely? Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a powerful solution that enables you to connect to a Windows machine from your macOS device. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use RDP to establish a remote connection to a Windows computer from your Mac.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the details, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A macOS computer.
- A Windows computer that is set up for remote desktop access.
- The IP address or hostname of the Windows computer you want to connect to.
- Credentials for the Windows computer.

If you haven't already set up your Windows computer for RDP, you can follow the instructions provided at the following link: [Enable RDP on Windows host](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-allow-access#how-to-enable-remote-desktop).

## Download the Microsoft Remote Desktop Application on the Mac

You will need a locally installed RDP client (a program that lets you connect to Windows computers that have RDP enabled). If you donâ€™t currently have one installed, we recommend downloading and installing the [Microsoft Remote Desktop Application](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop-10/id1295203466?mt=12
) from the Mac App Store. Once you have it installed, you can proceed.

## Launch and Configure Microsoft Remote Desktop Application

After launching the Microsoft Remote Desktop application, select the `+ sign` then `Desktop` to setup and configure a new connection

The only required information to provide is the PC name, which could be a hostname or IP address. You may enter a `Friendly name`, however, this is not a requirement even though it is great to have to keep everything organized.

Next, click `Add` to complete the connection process.
