In the dynamic realm of Linux, commands that were once commonplace have fallen out of favor and been deprecated in favor of more modern and efficient alternatives. Staying current with these changes is crucial for maintaining a secure and optimized system. In this blog post, we'll delve into some deprecated Linux commands and explore their recommended alternative tools.

## Ifconfig vs ip

The `ifconfig` command, once the go-to for network interface configuration, has now been deprecated. Linux users are advised to transition to using the `ip` command.

The `ip` command offers finer control over network configurations. To list network interfaces, you can use:

```bash
ip link show
```

## fdisk vs parted

In the past, the fdisk command was extensively used for partition management. However, it has been succeeded by parted, a tool boasting advanced features and a more user-friendly interface.

To create a new partition using parted, execute:

```bash
parted /dev/sdX mkpart primary ext4 0% 100%
```

## iwconfig vs iw

For wireless network interface configuration, the outdated iwconfig command used to be the norm. Nowadays, the preferred command is iw.

To display available wireless devices, use:

```bash
iw dev
```

## ifup vs systemctl

The outdated ifup and ifdown commands for network interface management have been supplanted by systemctl, a modern approach to networking control.

For instance, to initiate the network service, use:

```bash
sudo systemctl start NetworkManager
```

## svn vs git

While svn (Subversion) was once widely used for version control, it has been eclipsed by git due to its distributed and efficient nature.

To clone a repository using git, execute:

```bash
git clone repository_url
```

# Conclusion

As technology evolves, so does the Linux landscape. Deprecated commands make way for more potent, efficient, and feature-rich alternatives. Staying informed about these changes ensures your Linux system remains secure and up-to-date.
