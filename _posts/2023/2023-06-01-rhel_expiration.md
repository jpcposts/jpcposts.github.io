In RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux), you can change a user's expiration date using the terminal. Here's how:

- Open a terminal...

- Switch to the root user or use a user with administrative privileges.

- To view the current expiration date for a user, use the `chage` command with the `-l` option followed by the username:

```bash
chage -l username
```
  
- To change the expiration date for a user, use the chage command with the -E option followed by the new date in YYYY-MM-DD format:

```bash
chage -E YYYY-MM-DD username
```

  - Replace YYYY-MM-DD with the desired expiration date and username with the actual username.
    - Note: Make sure to choose an appropriate expiration date based on your requirements and security policies.

- Verify the changes by running the chage -l username command again.

```bash
chage -l username
```

  _Congratulations. That's it!!! You have successfully changed the expiration date for the RHEL user using the terminal._
