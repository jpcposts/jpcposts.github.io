Proxmox Virtual Environment (Proxmox VE) is a versatile open-source virtualization platform that combines Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) for virtual machines (VMs) and Linux Containers (LXC) for lightweight container-based virtualization. Whether for server consolidation or building cloud infrastructure, Proxmox VE is an excellent choice. This guide walks you through installing Proxmox VE on a bare-metal server.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A dedicated server or bare-metal machine with compatible hardware.
- A bootable USB drive or DVD containing the Proxmox VE ISO image. Download the latest ISO from the [official Proxmox website](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads).
- You may use [rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) or [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io) as options to create the bootable USB drive.
- Physical or remote access to the server for installation.

## Step 1: Boot from the Proxmox VE Installation Media

- Insert the bootable USB drive or DVD into the server's USB port or DVD drive.
- Power on or reboot the server.
- Access the BIOS or UEFI settings during the boot process to set the server to boot from the installation media. Consult your server's documentation for specific instructions.
- Save the changes and exit the BIOS or UEFI settings.
- The server will now boot from the Proxmox VE installation media.


## Step 2: Proxmox VE Installation Wizard

- The Proxmox VE installation wizard appears once the server boots from the installation media.
- Choose your preferred language and press Enter to continue.
- Select `Install Proxmox VE Graphical` and press Enter.
