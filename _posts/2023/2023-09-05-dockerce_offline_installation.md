In certain environments, you may need to install Docker-CE on a RHEL8 (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8) machine that does not have direct internet access. This can be a challenging task due to the dependencies Docker has on packages that are typically fetched from online repositories. In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to accomplish this task manually.

## Step 1: Download Docker-CE Packages

First, you'll need to download the required Docker-CE packages and their dependencies from a machine with internet access. You can obtain these packages from the Docker official website. Here's the direct link to the CentOS 8 repository:

[Download Docker-CE Packages](https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/8/x86_64/stable/Packages/)

Make sure to download the following packages:

- docker-ce
- docker-ce-cli
- docker-ce-rootless-extras
- docker-compose-plugin
- docker-scan-plugin
- containerd.io

## Step 2: Transfer Packages to Your RHEL8 Machine

Once you've downloaded the necessary packages, you'll need to transfer them to your RHEL8 machine, which lacks internet connectivity. You can use various methods for this, such as using a USB drive or a secure file transfer protocol like SCP (Secure Copy Protocol).

For instance, if you are using SCP to copy the files to the offline machine, you can use the following command:

```bash
scp /path/to/downloaded/packages/*.rpm user@hostnameORipaddress:/path/to/destination/folder/
```

## Step 3: Install Docker-CE Packages

Now that you have the packages on your RHEL8 machine, you can proceed with the installation. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the downloaded RPM files.

Use the rpm command to install the packages. For example:

```bash
cd /path/to/downloaded/packages
sudo yum install * -y
```

## Step 4: Resolve Dependencies

When installing Docker-CE for the first time on a RHEL8 machine without internet access, you might encounter dependency issues with the `runc` package. `runc` is used by Podman, which conflicts with Docker-CE. If necessary, you can remove `runc` and its dependencies with the following command:

```bash
sudo yum remove runc
```

## Step 5: Enable and Start Docker Service

After successfully installing the Docker-CE packages, you need to enable, start, and check the status of the Docker service. Use the following commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl status docker
```

**This will ensure that Docker is set to start automatically at boot and is running.**

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Docker-CE on your RHEL8 machine without internet access. You can now start using Docker to manage containers on your isolated/airgapped system.
