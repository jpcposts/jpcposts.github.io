## Introduction:

In the realm of collaborative software development, Git plays a pivotal role in version control. When it comes to contributing changes to a repository hosted on platforms like Bitbucket, the pull request (PR) becomes vital. This blog post unravels the intricacies of the Git workflow using Bitbucket and delves into the significance of pull requests.

## Git Workflow with Bitbucket:

### 1. Fork the Repository:

   - Create your own copy (fork) of the repository you want to contribute to.


### 2. Clone the Repository:

   - Clone your forked repository to your local machine using `git clone https://www.testrepo.git`.
   - You will likely be prompted for username/password credentials.

### 3. Create a New Branch:

   - Create a new branch for your changes using `git checkout -b feature-branch`.

   - If your organization uses Jira with Bitbucket, you may have the option to create a branch directly from within Jira. This option is likely within a Jira ticket, and you will see an option under the `Development` section of the ticket that says `Create branch`. 

   - If you are already connected to the `main` branch, you can switch to the newly created branch by running the `git switch feature-branch` command. Where feature-branch is the name of the new branch.

   - Another note : you may view your local branches by running the `git branch --list` command and you may view all available branches on the remote server by runnign the `git branch -a` command.


### 4. Make Changes:

   - Make the necessary changes to the code.

### 5. Commit Changes:

   - Commit your changes to the local branch using the `git add .` and `git commit -m "Description of Changes"` commands.

### 6. Push Changes:

   - Push your changes to your forked repository using `git push`.

### 7. Create Pull Request:

   - Go to Bitbucket and create a pull request from your branch to the target branch.

### 8. Review and Merge:

   - Other contributors/colleagues should now review your changes, and once approved, the changes CAN be merged into the target branch.

## The Role of Pull Requests:

Creating a pull request serves several essential purposes in collaborative software development:

### 1. **Code Review:**
   - A dedicated space for team members to review and discuss proposed changes, ensuring code quality and adherence to project standards.

### 2. **Collaboration:**
   - Facilitates collaboration by allowing developers to share work, gather feedback, and discuss potential improvements.

### 3. **Discussion:**
   - Includes a comment section for team members to discuss specific lines of code, ask questions, or provide feedback.

### 4. **Visibility:**
   - Provides clear visibility into proposed changes, showcasing who made the changes and when.

### 5. **Continuous Integration (CI) and Testing:**
   - Integration with CI systems for automatic testing to ensure proposed changes do not introduce new bugs.

### 6. **Documentation:**
   - Often includes documentation updates or additions to maintain consistency and keep documentation up to date.

### 7. **Maintainer Approval:**
   - Ensures changes are reviewed and approved by designated personnel before merging into the main branch.

### 8. **Version Control:**
   - Maintains a clear history of changes, making it easier to understand and roll back changes if needed.

## Pull Request as a Collaborative Space:

Creating a pull request is akin to showcasing your work and inviting team members to review and collaborate. It's about sharing changes, asking for feedback, and ensuring the project's best possible outcome.

### Showcasing Changes:

- Displaying the changes made to the project, allowing team members to see new additions or improvements.

### Asking for Feedback:

- Inviting team members to provide thoughts, suggest improvements, catch mistakes, or express approval.

### Collaborating:

- Working together by involving the team in the process, fostering idea-sharing, mutual assistance, and ensuring the project's excellence.

### Making Sure Everything Works:

- Confirming that changes integrate seamlessly with the existing project, ensuring overall functionality.


### Making Sure Everything Works:

In conclusion, mastering Git workflow with Bitbucket involves more than just creating pull requests. It's about adopting a comprehensive approach that encompasses branching, committing, testing, reviewing, documenting, versioning, leveraging Git hooks, and utilizing collaborative tools. A well-orchestrated Git workflow ensures a smooth and efficient development process, ultimately contributing to the success of the project.
